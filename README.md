# RNG Engine

A modular random number program engine built in Python (I plan to add C for embedded systems and low level stuff!) 
It also tracks all kinds of data such as all results ,  statistics such as modes , median and so on

## Structure

- `core/` — Core logic 
- `games/` — Game modules 

## Games

- 🎲 **Dice Roller**: Roll one or more dice and view results with ASCII art
- more to come in the future!


## How to Run

```bash
python -m games.Dice_roller
