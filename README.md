# RNG Engine

RNG Engine is a modular Python toolkit for all things random. Originally built as a dice statistics engine, its evolving into a full featured randomization suite including dice rollers, shufflers, number generators, and more. Designed for games, simulations, and creative tools where randomness matters!


## Structure

- `core/` — Core logic 
- `games/` — Game modules 


## Games

- 🎲 **Dice Roller**: Roll one or more dice and view results with ASCII art
- more to come in the future!


## 🛠️ Requirements

- Python 3.9+
- No external dependencies (uses built-in modules)


## How to Run

```bash
python -m games.Dice_roller

## 🧭 Roadmap

- [ ] GUI interface for rolling and viewing stats (overhaul for the dice roller game)
- [ ] Support for custom dice types (d8, d10, d20, etc.)
- [ ] Exportable roll history (CSV or JSON)
- [ ] Unit tests for core logic
- [ ] Interactive CLI improvements
